#AlGaAs_electro-optic_effect
This repository is intended to hold all related notes/work related to the measurement of the electro-optic effect at the SU gravitational wave physics lab

Compartmentalize the project into the following sections: 

Reading / Derivations
* Review the reflectivity of the stratisfied dielectric detailed in (Born and Wolf 1.6)
* Review Edgard's derivation of the differential phase change of the reflected field 
* Review Marty Fejer's notes on how the electro-optic effects of AlGaAs coatings

Work
* Help progress the thermal noise measurment (nodal suspesion setup)
* Preliminary noise estimates for measuring electro-optic effect
