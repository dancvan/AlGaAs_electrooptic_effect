\section{Listing Marty's figure}
For a entire stratified surface of AlGaAs with alternating layers of 10 \% and 90 \% Al concentration the estimated Electro-optic noise contribution:

$$ \frac{d \phi}{dE} = 4.5*10^{-10} $$

which.. in terms of a physical length from a double pass through the coating:
$$\phi *2*k*\Delta x = \frac{4 \pi* \Delta x}{\lambda}$$

so the following is the estimated length change as we change the incident electric field: 

$$ \frac{d x}{dE} =3.8101*10^{-17}$$

Say we assume a 0th order field from our capacitor system that we are developing:
\\
\\
For a 100 Vpk potential difference across a 1cm separation capacitor we have a field of 10,000 [V/m]
\\
\\ 
This then implies a peak length change of $3.8*10^{-13}\; [m]$
\\
\\ 
Now let's convert this into a Power
