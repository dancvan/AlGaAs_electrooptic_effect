During the group meeting we asked / answered some questions: 
* How big is this piezo electric effect?
* How are we going to go about measuring it?
	- Attach two split electrodes illustrated in the figure
	- Single FP cavity?
		~ How large is the laser frequency noise?
			+ Too large? Go to a Michelson configuration.
		~ Stefan suggests that a monolithic structure is the best way to go about this
	- Michelson interferometer?
		~ an extra beamsplitter and end mirror for this configuration
	- FPMI?
	- PRFPMI?
